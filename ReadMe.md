# HTML & CSS Simply Recipes

## Description
This basic HTML and CSS Recipe website was a tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8LTPIJBGwQ&t=2651s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org on youtube. I followed this course as a refresher on basic HTML and CSS concepts as well as to learn new topics such as the grid system in CSS and how to structure a more mobile and user friendly website on HTML. Almost all of this code is HTML and CSS except for a few features that use JavaScript, such as the date function on the footer section and the toggle fuctionality on the navbar.
